# Programmer
## Mar 2021 > Nov 2022

At Reckless Company, I was in charge of developing apps, databases, APIs, and dashboards, and also choosing the languages used and where to host the servers.   
To start development, me and my boss would have meetings where he described what he wanted, showed me mockups, and I would ask questions and take notes.   
After that, I would make the database, and prepare to work on the app. I would use his mockups as reference pictures, and would send screenshot and test versions. Once everything was done, we would look through the entire app looking for any bugs or visual imperfections.   
Something he did a lot was redesign the apps and add new features. While some changes did take a lot of work, most weren't too bad because I learnt to program in a way that I can easily change and adapt my code to fit new designs and add extra features.
