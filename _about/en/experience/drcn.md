# Database Developer
## Mar 2016 > Apr 2016

This was my first internship, which I did with a classmate, and a great opportunity to learn. 

The project developed was a database in Microsoft Access that allows users/managers to store, in real-time, the state of DRCN's IT, allowing for easy introduction, alteration, and deletion of all materials and equipment efficiently. 
The detection of a malfunction, by any worker, is communicated via email to the responsible worker in an automatic and controlled manner.

Here we had to deal with multiple changes, which made me improve and optimize my design of databases, and I started learning how to talk with clients with less knowledge of programming. It took the entire internship to understand what they needed, were it today I have a better understanding of what to ask and what people want.   
It was a learning experience, and Iâ€™m glad I was able to meet their requirements and improve a lot because of my time there.
