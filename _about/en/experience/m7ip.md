# Computer Programmer
## May 2017 > Aug 2017

Here my first task was to bug fix a mobile app written in Java.   
Once that task was completed, we started developing a new hybrid app, by using Phonegap to implement Web code for mobile platforms. This project involved working in a team with other programmers and having meetings.   
During development, I learnt more about SQL, and discovered Phonegap/Cordova and Framework7, which help create apps with web code and design them easily. It was my first experience developing a complete app, with push notification, login with third parties and even Google Maps integration.
