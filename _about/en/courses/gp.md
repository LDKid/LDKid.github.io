# Create an Android App with Kotlin
## Oct 2022

In this 1.5 hours class, I created my first Kotlin Android app, which was a guessing game. The app would select a random number between 1 and 25 and the user would write their guess in an input field and press the submit button. It would then display a hint (too high or too low) until the user wrote the correct number, at which point it will display the number of guesses it took.
