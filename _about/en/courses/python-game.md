# Problem solving, Python programing and Video Games
## Sep 2021

The course uses the Python programing language and video games as a fun way to teach computer science concepts, however, the knowledge and skills from this course apply to other languages and non-game problems. Some of the concepts taught are problem-solving, problem decomposition, algorithms, abstraction, and software quality.   
Lexical, Syntax and Semantic analysis were also taught and practiced.   
During the course, I was tasked with recreating two games: Hacking (which had 7 versions) and Poke the Dots (which had 5 versions), version by version. To do this, I had to observe and play them, then assemble a description, functional test plan, and algorithm, and then I coded using Python.
