## Hello! My name is Fl√°vio Ferreira, I was born in 1997, in Portugal.

I enjoy developing diverse, fun, and valuable projects and love programming as a whole.

I grew up playing video games and always dreamt of making my own. As I grew older that interest expanded into something broader:
I found that whenever I used a new app, visited a new website, or played a new game, I wondered how it worked behind the scenes..

My career goals are to create my own company and develop apps that are useful and games which are enjoyable, without useless filler, annoying ads, or abusive microtransactions.
