# Flávio Ferreira's Portfolio Website

Website built with Jekyll.  
This website was made to showcase my projects and programming skills.

## Information about the project

It was made slowly during free time, so progress was slow, and future updates may take a while.

The idea was, once the website was fully set up, it should be easy for me to add new projects to the portfolio page, automatically update the latest project displayed on the Home page, update the about section, and just easily customize each element.   
It has support for dark/light mode and multiple languages.   
This website should not only showcase my projects but in itself showcase my programming skills.

This project was designed by me (Flávio Ferreira) and João Rodrigo. The design does not follow standard sizes, instead opting to follow a specific theme.

## Pixelated Theme

The theme of this project is meant to reference my gaming roots, originally getting into programming because I wanted to make video games.   
For this, the fonts used are pixelated, and everything is very big and square. The golden accent color also reminds me of old-school games, especially the header.   
To add to the gaming feel, each page (other than the project pages) has its own game *(404 also will have a game soon)*! To play, simply press the controller, and there should be a crossfade between the page and the game, with neither ever becoming fully invisible.

The games are just something extra, something fun that should also help showcase my programming. They are made in an HTML canvas, this was also the first time I used the HTML canvas.

## Why Jekyll?
I wanted to challenge myself to learn something new, and explore what Jekyll and Liquid can do.
