#### Personal Reflection

This app is the perfect example of why you should keep things simple. The app kept evolving and more features were being added to it constantly, this turned an otherwise easy to use app into one that requires time to learn how to use.   
I learnt a lot making this app, and I'm proud of all I could achieve, having been able to add every feature and make every change that was requested.

###### This was my first project made during my time at [Reckless Company](https://www.recklesscompany.com).
