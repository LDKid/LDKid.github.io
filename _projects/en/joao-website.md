João is a portuguese graphics designer and illustrator, the creator of [Hallo](https://joaorodrigocarvalho.github.io/projetos/hallo).

His website was made with the goal of sharing his work, thus serving as a portfolio. To accomplish this, it's structured in a way João can manage the content of his website autonomously.

The standout feature of the website is the <span id="jota-ee-t">color picker</span> in the homepage. By default, it's set to a yellow, but as you slide it you'll see that backgrounds and icons that used that color are changing. This affects all pages in the website.
It was made to be responsive, with elements changing size, position, color and functionality depending on screen size; and icons will automatically adapt so they will always follow a set pattern.

#### Personal Reflection

It was interesting to work with João, and I enjoyed coding the website in a way thats easy to change and customise everything.
I'm happy with all I accomplished.

###### This website was part of a trade of services between the programmer and designer, João designed my website and I programmed his.
