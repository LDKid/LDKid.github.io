#### Personal Reflection

My first project using **Flutter**, and it was a very enjoyable learning experience.   
The standout feature from this app for me was the search bar.   
I also made a dashboard for this app using **Node.js**, **EJS**, and to develop it faster, **Bootstrap**.   
The dashboard was simple to make, with every page and popup following the same visual format.

##### This app was made during my time at [Reckless Company](https://www.recklesscompany.com).
