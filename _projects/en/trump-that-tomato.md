This project was requested by a friend; it was meant to be something fun, even the description here will be more light hearted.

Get off your seats, put your hand close to your heart and say WE THE PEOPLE! Throw as many tomatoes to Donnie Trumpster as you can, but be carefull not to waste them, he's surprisingly fast and can hide.
You have 2 game modes: Time Attack, where you have 1 minute to throw as many tomatoes as you can; and a Classic mode where if you miss 3 times, you're out!

This was my first game, published back in 2016 on Newgrounds. It was made in a day using ActionScript3, the Flixel framework and Newgrounds API for the medals and leaderboards.
