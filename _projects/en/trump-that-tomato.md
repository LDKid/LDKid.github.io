This was my first ever game, published back in 2016 on [Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/674659).   
It was made in a day using ActionScript3, the Flixel framework and Newgrounds API for the medals and leaderboards.

#### Gameplay

The game has two game modes:
- Time Attack, where you have one minute to throw as many tomatoes as you can;
- Classic, where if you miss three times, the game ends.

Your objective is to throw tomatoes at Trump. Each hit scores you a point.   
He moves randomly, sometimes dashing, and can raise his arms and lower himself, making himself invulnerable.   

#### Newgrounds API

Newgrounds API was used to add three features:
- Leaderboards, once a game ends, the player’s score is displayed and then saved in the leaderboards.
- Ads, when the game is loading, it shows an ad, allowing me to monetise the game.
- Medals, these are achievements you can unlock by playing the game. An example was “We shall overcomb” which requires the player to hit Trump 40 times in one round of Time Attack.

#### How to play Flash games after 2020

[Flash](https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html) reached the end of its life on December 2020, but there are multiple ways to play Flash games even today.   
The way I recommend playing the game is through the [Newgrounds Flash Player](https://www.newgrounds.com/flash/player), a desktop app that allows you to play Newgrounds games.

#### Personal Reflection

For my first game, I've proud of all I managed to achieve.   
Gameplay wise, it's exactly as I imagined it, visually leaves a lot to be desired, and the Newgrounds API allowed me to add Leaderboards which I originally did not plan to do.
